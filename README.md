# High Low Card Game
Hi! Welcome! This is my Java game simulating the card game known as "High Low"

High Low is a card game where a player guesses whether the current card is higher or lower than the next card

Uses the power of JPanels and JOptionpanes to handle the GUI aspect of the game!

-Java needed to run the program

-All images used are as shown in the directory

-The poker cards are based off of Nintendo's Splatoon game!

Feel free to use the below link to access an executable jar file of the program. Thanks!
